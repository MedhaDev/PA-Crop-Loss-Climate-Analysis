# Research Brief: Excess Moisture and Crop Loss in Pennsylvania

## 📌 Executive Summary
Between 2017 and 2023, Pennsylvania experienced significant agricultural economic impact due to climate-driven moisture patterns. This project analyzes **$284.8M in crop loss data** to identify high-risk regions and provide actionable recommendations for climate-resilient infrastructure planning.

## 📊 Business Problem
State agencies required a localized understanding of where excess moisture was causing the most financial damage to guide funding and policy adoption for 67 counties.

## 🛠️ Method & Tools
* **Data Sources:** USDA Risk Management Agency (RMA) data and PaSDC records.
* **Tech Stack:** SQL (Data Extraction), Python (Trend Analysis), Excel (Validation).
* **Skills:** Statistical Analysis, Requirement Gathering, Policy Writing.

## 💡 Key Insights & Impact
* **Financial Impact:** Identified $284.8M in moisture-related losses.
* **Regional Patterns:** Identified specific counties requiring prioritized drainage infrastructure.
* **Outcome:** Published recommendations currently used to support statewide climate-resilient planning decisions.
